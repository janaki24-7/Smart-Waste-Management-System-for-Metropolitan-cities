# Smart-Waste-Management-System-for-Metropolitan-cities
Smart waste management system which is proposed here is to implement a smarter way of conventional waste management using smart sensors to gather fill-level data from smart garbage bins. This project proposes the development of a smart waste management system that uses two ultrasonic sensors and one servo motor to monitor the level of a dustbin and display it on an Arduino monitor in real-time.The system works by using two ultrasonic sensors to measure the distance between the top of the dustbin and the surface of the waste inside it. The readings from the sensors are then transmitted to an Arduino microcontroller, which processes the data and determines the level of waste in the dustbin. It eliminates the need for manual monitoring of dustbins, reducing labor costs and increasing efficiency. It also ensures that dustbins are emptied only when necessary, reducing unnecessary waste and promoting sustainability.The system offers an efficient and effective way of managing waste, promoting sustainability, and reducing labor costs.
